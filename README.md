<!--The final year project of Anushree Kolhe, Ruchi Bheke and Aditya Borude for the course of B.E. Computer Engineering at S.I.E.S. Graduate School of Technology in the academic session 2018-2022.-->

### Introduction
The voice is a principal tool allowing individuals to communicate and exchange information
in their day-to-day activities. However, any slight alteration in the voice production system
might affect the voice quality. Speech dysfunction deviates quality, pitch, loudness, or vocal
flexibility from voices of age, gender, and social classes. However, the individuals at high risk
of developing voice disorders are teachers. Due to prolonged speaking periods, vocal strain
from teaching in lecture rooms with poor acoustics or high background noises, the vocal
damage exacerbates. These disorders are also observed in other individuals who use their
voice professionally, like singers, lawyers, call center professionals, etc. The probability of
this malady occurring is high in females and older individuals. With the use of advanced
technology, like deep learning, it is possible to identify the symptoms of such illnesses at an
early stage and prevent severe damage to vocal organs.

### Need of Project
A pathological voice is a result of disorders or damage to the vocal organs by any means, and
is not limited to pathogens, like viruses, bacteria, fungus, and parasites. Voice pathology can
be caused by tissue infection, systemic changes, mechanical stress, surface irritation, tissue
changes, neurological and muscular changes, and other factors. Due to vocal pathology, the
mobility, functionality, and shape of the vocal folds are affected resulting in irregular
vibrations and increased acoustic noise. Such voice sounds strained, harsh, weak, and breathy,
which significantly contributes to the overall poor voice quality. The consequence of such
pathological speech disorders is not life-threatening. However, the effects of untreated voice
dysfunction may have a drastic impact on social, occupational, and personal aspects of
communication.

### Scope
The proposed framework focuses on early diagnosis and treatment of pathological voice
disorder with the aid to deep learning models. It also sheds light on a unique pathway to
develop a system which requires less computational complexity and provides faster
processing as compared to the traditional systems.

Deliverables of the project can be summarized as follows :
- Cost-effective and accurate diagnosis reports provided to the patients
- User-friendly & remotely accessible application for both, patients as well as medical
professionals
<br>

Exclusions and constraints of the proposed project can be elucidated as follows: 
- The focus of the system will be on the detection of functional dysphonia, limited to
physical damage only, and will not consider other pathologies. Other pathologies are
out of the scope of this project.
- The system will face a cold-start problem for discriminating the changes in the voice,
as the use of the Comparator network is possible only if previously recorded audio of
the patient is available.
- Exceptional cases might occur in the classification phase, as there is a possibility of
multiple pathologies (other than the one due to physical damage) having similar
characteristics and symptoms. In this case, the pathology will be detected but will be
misclassified and needs to be further investigated by the medical professional.

### Application
The application of the suggested system is in the biomedical field where it will provide an
individual, easy accessibility to medical assistance as well as cost effective and accurate
diagnosis of voice disorders caused due to physical detriment.
